Project for Advanced Database Analytics course at Utah State University. In this project, I use SQL Server and Python to build a program that asks the user to enter green, yellow and gray letters for the daily Wordle, then uses a dictionary database to suggest a new word to try. Suggetsions use past Wordle answers to determine most likely words based on frequency of letters both overall and in a specific place in the word, as well as discounting words with duplicate letters. This project was done two different ways, one with the logic in SQL Server and one with the logic in Python.
