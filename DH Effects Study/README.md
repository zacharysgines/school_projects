This project was done for the Multivariate Statistics course at Utah Valley University. In this project, I perform a multivariate analysis to determine if the introduction of the designated hitter to the National League in 2022 had a significant impact on overall offensive performance. This is done by analyzing the difference in the National League and the American League prior to and after adding the designated hitter to the National League.
